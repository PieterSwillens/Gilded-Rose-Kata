# Gilded Rose Kata

The starting code for this exercise can be found [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

## Objective of the exercise
The goal is to add an item with its own behaviours into an already existing catalog. However, you'll soon realize that this won't be an easy task, since we're dealing with a legacy code base.  
The idea is to refactor the code without losing its functionality, so that adding the new item would be a breeze.
