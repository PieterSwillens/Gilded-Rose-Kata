# Gilded Rose Kata
The starting code for this exercise can be found [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

## Objective of the exercise
The goal is to add an item with its own behaviours into an already existing catalog. However, you'll soon realize that this won't be an easy task, since we're dealing with a legacy code base.  
Therefore, it is necessary to refactor the already existing code without it losing its functionality.

## Solution
My solution to this problem and the corresponding test classes can be found under the 'src' folder. If you're interested in delving deeper into my thought process behind the refactoring decisions or have any questions about the implementation, feel free to reach out to me.  
I'm open to discussing insights and exchanging ideas and I look forward to engaging with fellow developers and enthusiasts!
